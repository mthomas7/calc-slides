Product Rule
===

$$\frac{d}{dx} f(x)g(x) = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)$$

Examples
===
For each of the following:

* Graph the function on desmos
* Sketch what the derivative should look like
* Compute the derivative - use product rule or prior rules
* Plot the derivative you computed
* Have desmos plot the derivative
* Rinse and repeat

***

1. $2^x \sin(x)$
2. $2xe^x-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$
3. $\frac{e^x}{x^2}$
4. $\frac{5x^3+2x-4}{x^2}$
5. $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$
6. $(3x^2+5x)e^x$
7. $5^x \cos(x) \ln(x)$
8. $\frac{\sin(x)\cos(x)}{x}$

The Quotient Rule
===
incremental:true

* Suppose $Q(x) = \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
* Let's rewrite $Q(x)g(x) = f(x)$

Examples
===

* $\dfrac{5x^2}{x^3+1}$
* $\dfrac{1}{1+e^x}$
* $\dfrac{e^x}{x^2}$

Dosages
===
A dose, $D$, of a drug (in mg) causes a temperature change, $T$ (in degrees $C$), in a patient. For $C$ a positive constant, $T$ is given by:

$$T = \left( \frac{C}{2} - \frac{D}{2} \right) D^2$$

* What is the rate of change of temperature with respect to dose?
* For what doeses does the temerature change increase as the dose increases?
