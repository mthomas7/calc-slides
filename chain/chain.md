Another example
===
Suppose a bookstore makes an average profit of \$3 per book, and its sales are increasing at a rate of 40 books per month. At what rate is its monthly profit increasing, in dollars per month?
* $t$ will be time in months
* $s$ is the number of books
* $p$ is profit in dollars

Back to weight gain
===
Suppose height is a function of age: $$H(A) = 6.5 A + 74$$

Weight is a function of height: $$W(H) = 0.00072H^{2.17}$$

As age increases, how quickly does height increase?

An Oil Tanker
===
A ruptured oil tanker causes a circular oil slick on the surface of the ocean. When its radius is 150 meters, the radius of the slick is expanding by 0.1 meter/minute and its thickness is 0.03 meter. At that moment:
* How fast is the area of the slick expanding?
* The circular slick has the same thickness everywhere, and the volume of the oil spilled remains fixed. How fast is the thickness of the slick decreasing?

A Triangle
===
A right triangle has one leg of 7 cm. How fast is its area changing at the instant that the other leg has length 10 cm and is decreasing at 2 cm per second?

===
While Violet Beauregarde is visiting Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, she
snatches some experimental gum against Wonka’s warnings. Not yet perfected,
the gum has the side effect of expanding Violet into a giant human blueberry. At
one point, after she becomes perfectly spherical, she reaches a volume of $1.8 m^3$
and is still growing at $0.2 m^3/s$. How fast is her surface area increasing?

===
The speed limit on a straight stretch of highway is 55 mph. Lucy, a highway
patrol officer, stations herself at a point out of view of the motorists 50 feet off the
highway. She is equipped with a radar gun which measures the speed at which a
car approaches her position. She takes a reading of suspected speeders by
pointing her radar gun at a point on the highway 120 feet from the point on the
highway closest to her. The radar gun picks up a reading of 48 feet/sec for a green
Chevy driven by Bob and Mark returning to campus from an epic road trip.
Should they get a ticket? Justify.

A streetlight hangs 5 meters above the ground. Landen has the ability to magically
shrink herself. At what rate must she do this to keep her shadow a constant length
of 3 meters while walking away from the light at a speed of 2 m/s?

Inspired by recently renting "Saturday Night Fever" Art and Sam are redecorating
their 16'x12' living room in a disco theme. Kelli stops by to drop off a ladder they
had asked to borrow, but when Tim opens the door, she is shocked by the sight of
a disco ball rotating once every 2 seconds from the center of the ceiling. Her
horror is replaced by a trance-like state as she is hypnotized from tracking one of
the spots of light spinning around the room. As this spot of light enters a corner
going from a long wall to a short wall, how fast is it moving?

===
Assume that Lou is perfectly spherical and that he melts at a rate proportional to
his surface area, $A$ (i.e., $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=kA$ for some negative constant k.) How fast is Lou’s
radius changing when it passes the 3 cm mark? when his radius is 5 cm? when his
radius is r cm? (Your answers might involve the constant k.)

===
Andrew and Miguel are on their annual hunting trip. This time, however, they
plan on outsmarting the deer! Andrew is sitting to Miguel's right (east) when the
perfect buck appears 40 meters to the north. Miguel aims, but Andrew sneezes an
inhumanly loud sneeze. The deer startles and takes off straight southeast at 13
meters per second. Miguel turns to keep the deer centered in his sight, but can’t
get a clean shot. At the instant Miguel smacks Andrew in the head with the barrel
of the rifle, how fast was he rotating?

===
Elizabeth has the ability to walk on vertical surfaces, and is walking up and down
a 5 meter tall lamp post at a rate of 1.5 m/s. Remi, while curious about how
Elizabeth is able to stay on the lamppost, decides to work on a more practical
problem and compute how fast Elizabeth's shadow is shrinking. How fast is the
shadow shrinking when Elizabeth is on her way down and reaches the ground.

After realizing they aren’t actually IN a biology class, and therefore don’t NEED
to study for the test, Sid and Tom are using their windfall free time by painting
the walls of the math lounge Navy and Gold. Sid is standing on top of a two-piece
extension ladder leaning against the wall when Jill walks by. Jill becomes upset
that Sid and Tom are covering up her favorite orange and yellow paisley
wallpaper, so she kicks the base of the ladder. Suddenly, the ladder starts
collapsing at the rate of 2 feet per second AND, at the same time, its base starts
sliding away from the wall at the rate of 3 feet per second. How fast is Sid falling
(the top of the ladder moving down the wall) when he is 8 feet from the ground
and the base is 6 feet from the wall?

===
Anne and Kim live next to Bart who has a very loud stereo. The volume knob
goes to 11, turning half a circle (angles  between 0 and 180 ). The volume of
the music, usually Ylvis, is given by the function $V(\theta) = 110 \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})$ decibels (dB). One night at 3:30 in the morning they hear "gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!" increasing from a volume of 88 dB at a rate of 1 decibel per
second! At what rate can Anne and Kim deduce that Bart is cranking the volume knob?

===
Tom is tired and decides to turn in from a late-night calculus study session for the
Chapter 4 exam. Carol is determined to keep everyone working and has set up a
searchlight 30 yards straight out from one corner of ROSS Hall. Jon starts running
from that corner along the wall and Carol keeps the spotlight trained on him.
When he is 50 yards down the wall, Carol is turning the spotlight at a rate of 0.07
radians per second. How fast is Tom running at that point?

===
Art is trying to fill his Pocahontas-themed play pool with a hose at a rate of
$0.06 m^3/min$. The top of the pool is 2 m by 2 m square, the "beach entry" has zero
depth along one side, and the "deep end" is 0.5 m at the opposite side with a
constant slope in between. Art is unaware that Jessie has drilled a small hole in
the deep end to drain water while he tries to fill it. When the water is half way to
the top of the deep end, Art notices the depth there only seems to be rising at 0.02
m/min. At what rate should he infer water is draining out of the hole?
