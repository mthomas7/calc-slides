Another example
===
Suppose a bookstore makes an average profit of \$3 per book, and its sales are increasing at a rate of 40 books per month. At what rate is its monthly profit increasing, in dollars per month?
* $t$ will be time in months
* $s$ is the number of books
* $p$ is profit in dollars

Back to weight gain
===
Suppose height is a function of age: $$H(A) = 6.5 A + 74$$

Weight is a function of height: $$W(H) = 0.00072H^{2.17}$$

As age increases, how quickly does height increase?

Problem 0:An Oil Tanker
===
A ruptured oil tanker causes a circular oil slick on the surface of the ocean. When its radius is 150 meters, the radius of the slick is expanding by 0.1 meter/minute and its thickness is 0.03 meter. At that moment:
* How fast is the area of the slick expanding?
* The circular slick has the same thickness everywhere, and the volume of the oil spilled remains fixed. How fast is the thickness of the slick decreasing?

Problem 0.5:A Triangle
===
A right triangle has one leg of constant length 7 cm. How fast is its area changing at the instant that the other leg has length 10 cm and is decreasing at 2 cm per second?

Problem 1
===
While Violet Beauregarde is visiting Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, she
snatches some experimental gum against Wonka’s warnings. Not yet perfected,
the gum has the side effect of expanding Violet into a giant human blueberry. At
one point, after she becomes perfectly spherical, she reaches a volume of $1.8 m^3$
and is still growing at $0.2 m^3/s$. How fast is her surface area increasing?

Problem 2
===
The speed limit on a straight stretch of highway is 55 mph. Maura, a highway
patrol officer, stations herself at a point out of view of the motorists 50 feet off the
highway. She is equipped with a radar gun which measures the speed at which a
car approaches her position. She takes a reading of suspected speeders by
pointing her radar gun at a point on the highway 120 feet from the point on the
highway closest to her. The radar gun picks up a reading of 48 feet/sec for a green
Chevy driven by Bria Garrett returning to campus from an epic road trip. Should they get a ticket? Justify.

Problem 3
===
A streetlight hangs 5 meters above the ground. Katie has the ability to magically shrink herself. At what rate must she do this to keep her shadow a constant length
of 3 meters while walking away from the light at a speed of 2 m/s?

Problem 4
===
Inspired by recently renting "Saturday Night Fever" Nate and Chris are redecorating
their 16'x12' living room in a disco theme. Nicole stops by to drop off a ladder they had asked to borrow, but when she opens the door, she is shocked by the sight of
a disco ball rotating once every 2 seconds from the center of the ceiling. Her horror is replaced by a trance-like state as she is hypnotized from tracking one of
the spots of light spinning around the room. As this spot of light enters a corner going from a long wall to a short wall, how fast is it moving?

Problem 5
===
Assume that Josh is perfectly spherical and that he melts at a rate proportional to his surface area, $A$ (i.e., $\dfrac{dV}{dt}=kA$ for some negative constant k.) How fast is Josh's radius changing when it passes the 3 cm mark? when his radius is 5 cm? when his
radius is r cm? (Your answers might involve the constant k.)

Problem 6
===
Kenny and Kandace are on their annual hunting trip. This time, however, they plan on outsmarting the deer. Kenny is sitting to Kandace's right (east) when the perfect buck appears 40 meters to the north. Kandace aims, but Kenny sneezes an inhumanly loud sneeze. The deer startles and takes off straight southeast at 13 meters per second. Kandace turns to keep the deer centered in his sight, but can’t get a clean shot. At the instant Kandace smacks Kenny in the head with the barrel of the rifle, how fast was he rotating?

Problem 7
===
Caroline has the ability to walk on vertical surfaces, and is walking up and down a 5 meter tall lamp post at a rate of 1.5 m/s. Charlie, while curious about how
Caroline is able to stay on the lamppost, decides to work on a more practical problem and compute how fast Caroline's shadow is shrinking. How fast is the
shadow shrinking when Caroline is on her way down and reaches the ground.

Problem 8
===
After realizing they aren’t actually IN a biology class, and therefore don’t NEED
to study for the test, Thomas and Tomas are using their windfall free time by painting the walls of the math lounge blue and yellow. Thomas is standing on top of a two-piece extension ladder leaning against the wall when Leah walks by. Leah becomes upset that Thomas and Tomas are covering up her favorite orange and yellow paisley
wallpaper, so she kicks the base of the ladder. Suddenly, the ladder starts collapsing at the rate of 2 feet per second AND, at the same time, its base starts sliding away from the wall at the rate of 3 feet per second. How fast is Thomas falling (the top of the ladder moving down the wall) when he is 8 feet from the ground and the base is 6 feet from the wall?

Problem 9
===
Stuti and Sarah live next to Jeremy who has a very loud stereo. The volume knob goes to 11, turning half a circle (angles $\theta$ between 0 and 180). The volume of
the music, usually Ylvis, is given by the function $V(\theta) = 110 \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})$ decibels (dB). One night at 3:30 in the morning they hear "gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!" increasing from a volume of 88 dB at a rate of 1 decibel per
second! At what rate can Stuti and Sarah deduce that Jeremy is cranking the volume knob?

Problem 10
===
Isha is tired and decides to turn in from a late-night calculus study session for the next quiz. Colten is determined to keep everyone working and has set up a
searchlight 30 yards straight out from one corner of the east tower. Andrew starts running from that corner along the wall and Colten keeps the spotlight trained on him.
When he is 50 yards down the wall, Colten is turning the spotlight at a rate of 0.07 radians per second. How fast is Andrew running at that point?

Problem 11
===
Ian is trying to fill his Pocahontas-themed play pool with a hose at a rate of $0.06 m^3/min$. The top of the pool is 2 m by 2 m square, the "beach entry" has zero
depth along one side, and the "deep end" is 0.5 m at the opposite side with a constant slope in between. Ian is unaware that Isha has drilled a small hole in
the deep end to drain water while he tries to fill it. When the water is half way to the top of the deep end, Ian notices the depth there only seems to be rising at 0.02
m/min. At what rate should he infer water is draining out of the hole?
