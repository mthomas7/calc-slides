How do we optimize functions?
===
* This means looking for maxima and minima
* We'll look at examples of why we might want to optimize in the real world in a bit - first we'll find a procedure.
* What is true about a function at a maximum or a minimum?

Some language
===
* Local max
* Local min
* Global max
* Global min

Examples
===
* $f(x)=-2x^2+3x+3$
* $f(x)=\ln\left(x\right)-x$
* $f(x)=x^3$
* $f(x)=x^{2/3}$

Lessons
===
* If $f'(x)=0$, this *may* be a max/min (but it doesn't have to be)
* If $f'(x)$ is undefined, this *may* be a max/min (but it doesn't have to be)
* These are called "critical points."

A different question
===
What is the minimum of the function $f(x)= -2x^2+3x+3$ on the interval from $x=0$ to $x=2$?

Lesson
===
When looking for maxes/mins on a specific interval, we may also need to check endpoints.

Procedure
===




Application Procedure
===
* Draw a diagram with all relevant constants and variables labeled.
* Write a function expressing the quantity to be minimized/maximized as a function of one other variable. Show all the work required to derive this formula.
* State the domain of the function covering all possible configurations for your problem.
* Find the required maximum/minimum. Show all your work and explain why each part of your work makes sense.
* You may find you need some formulas from geometry to solve these problems. Use Google to find anything you need on this front.
